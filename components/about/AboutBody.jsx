                    As Canadaâ€™s economy evolved, some trends became obvious:
                    demand for skilled workers grew; businesses started recruiting globally;
                    and the role academic institutions play to spur economic growth and
                    long-term competitiveness became apparent. At the same time, Canada's
                    reputation as safe, developed with affordable and top-notch education
